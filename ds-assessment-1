## ðŸ”¹ Technical Questionnaire â€“ **Data Analyst (Data Science Competence)**

> **Instructions:** Please complete the questions below. Include code snippets in Python/SQL where applicable and clearly explain your approach.

---

### **Section A: SQL & Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. **SQL Task:**
   You have a table `events` with:

   * `user_id` (STRING)
   * `event_type` (STRING)
   * `event_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)

   **Write a query to find the number of unique users who triggered both a `signup` and a `purchase` event within 7 days.**

2. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   Given a dataset with customer transactions, how would you identify:

   * High-value customers?
   * Seasonality trends?

### **Section B: Python & Modeling**

3. **Python Task:**
   You're given a dataset with features: `user_id`, `last_login_days_ago`, `num_purchases`, `avg_purchase_value`, and a binary target `churned`.

   * Write Python code to prepare this data for a logistic regression model.
   * Briefly explain how you'd evaluate the model performance.

4. **Machine Learning:**
   You are asked to build a customer segmentation model.

   * Which algorithm(s) would you use and why?
   * What preprocessing would you do before modeling?

---

### **Section C: Applied Case**

5. **Business Case:**
   A product team wants to understand what factors lead to user conversion (first purchase).

   * What approach would you take to analyze this?
   * How would you explain your findings to a non-technical stakeholder?
