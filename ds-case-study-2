### 📂 Case Study: Predicting Churn for BonusLink Members

Your goal is to identify members who are at risk of becoming inactive (i.e., not transacting for the next 3 months). Management wants to proactively engage these members with marketing campaigns.

You are given the following mock datasets:

* `transactions.csv` — member ID, merchant ID, spend amount, and timestamp
* `members.csv` — member ID, signup date, tier, age group, and state
* `engagement.csv` — logins, redemptions, and app usage metrics

---

### 🧠 Task:

1. **Problem Framing**

   * Define what “churn” means in this context
   * Describe the prediction goal and evaluation approach

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Propose and compute meaningful features that may influence churn
   * Handle missing or inconsistent data where applicable

3. **Modeling**

   * Build a simple predictive model using Python (e.g., logistic regression, tree-based model)
   * Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (ROC, precision-recall, etc.)

4. **Explainability & Business Implications**

   * Share key features influencing churn (e.g., SHAP, permutation importance)
   * Recommend how the business can act on these insights

### 🚀 Submission Instructions:

1. Create a **GitHub repository** with:

   * Python code and notebooks
   * A `README.md` explaining your logic, feature choices, and model results
   * Any visualizations or data storytelling elements (charts, confusion matrix, etc.)
   * Bonus: Use folders like `/data/`, `/notebooks/`, `/scripts/` for clarity

2. Name the repo: `ds-takehome-[yourname]`

3. Share the GitHub repo link with anusia@bonuslink.com.my
